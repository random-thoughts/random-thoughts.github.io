    <p>As I write this in the fall of 2020 I have been retired almost two years. The last job I had was as a Coffee and Vending Machine Service technician.
       My territory covered parts of four states, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky. I saw many beautiful and
       interesting things during my travels, taking pictures when I could. I hope you enjoy them.
