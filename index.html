  <h3>The pessimist complains about the wind, the optimist expects it to change, the realist adjusts the sails.</h3>
  <h2>Welcome to my world, a place where I let my mind wander where it will</h2>
  <div class="container-fluid"> 
    <img class="img-fluid" src=images/puter.gif  class="float-left"  alt= "2 small dragons, a cat and computer" >

   <p> On these pages I share those wanderings, thoughts that have appeared randomly, with no structure or deep meaning. 
     Just the ramblings of an old man that has seen many things around the world. Enjoy, or not, that is your choice.</p>

  <p> Most people have heard of the Serenity Prayer, "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." I have a variation I try to use in my daily life, "O Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the people I cannot change, the courage to change the “one” I can, and the
  wisdom to know that "that one" is ME!"

   <p> From Mr. Inbetween, a very interesting TV show from Australia: “You know why the world is full of A-holes? Because they get away with it. If you take away personal responsibility you get anarchy. Actions should have consequences that fit the action". <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/mr-inbetween">For more information about the show </a>

   <p>Nietzsche’s complaint against philosophers: They all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through logic whereas, in fact, a prejudiced proposition, idea, or “suggestion,” which is generally their heart’s desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event.</p>
