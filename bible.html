<h2>Things Often Misquoted and General Musings About the Bible</h2>
<hr>

<hr>

<p>First I will give you a little of my background. I have been a life long Christian, being raised Catholic back when the Mass was done in Latin. 
    After High School and joining the US Army I drifted away, always believing in God but becoming disenchanted with the hypocrisy I saw in organized religion in general.
    Later I was introduced to a Non-Denominational group of Christians. I started to study the Bible on my own, learning about the how and why of it all. One day as I was 
    browsing in a bookshop and I came across a CD that had Bible reading software on it. It contained 7 different versions of the Bible along with a library of Commentaries
    other related books. After using it my eyes were really opened. I now start every day reading and learning, looking up things I don’t fully understand. Here is a link to 
    the current version, <a href=" https://www.logos.com/ ">Logos 8</a>, along with a link to the Parent Company, <a href="https://faithlife.com/ ">faithlife.com</a> .
    While it may seem intimidating at first, the software is aimed at Pastors and Seminary students, there is a free basic version available along with excellent Help support if you need it.</p>
<aside>Some of the books I have been reading lately are <a href="https://www.rebeccamclaughlin.org/confronting-christianity ">Confronting Christianity</a>,
    <a href="https://ebooks.faithlife.com/product/190503/understanding-intelligent-design-everything-you-need-to-know-in-plain-language "> Understanding Intelligent Design</a>,
    <a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/none-of-these-diseases-3rd-edition/179863">None of These Diseases</a>, which is also avilable as a <a href="https://pdf.wecabrio.com/none-of-these-diseases-by-mcmillen.pdf ">PDF</a>,
    and <a href="http://forensicfaithbook.com/ ">Forensic Faith</a> which is how a Homicide Detective makes a case for Christianity.  
</aside>
    <p>On this page I will try to help clear up some of the misconceptions and misquotes about the Bible. I don't claim to know everything, and I don't want to challange anybody's faith, just shed a little light into the darkness.
    It is human nature to fear what we don’t understand, and we grow through learning, so let us grow together.</p>

  <h3 id="Q1" > Fear the Lord</h3>
    <p >The first thing I want to say is that I think when the early translators used the phrase “Fear the Lord”, 
    the word “fear” was a bad choice. Translating from one language to another is not an easy thing to do. 
    Sometimes they had to guess what word was the closest to the intended meaning. Logos has tool called the 
    “Interlinear Explorer” that shows passages in different languages along with their meaning. 
    The Hebrew word translated to fear means "To have a reverent attitude toward Yahweh that necessitates trust and obedience". 
    I guess they did the best they could. But the God I know is all about love, not fear.

  <h3 id="Q2" >Don't you Judge me</h3>

  <p>I have been blessed by having good teachers of the faith. One of the first things I was taught was how
    to look at a biblical passage. You need to know who is talking, to whom they are talking, what is the 
    situation, and when it is taking place. The last is very important to the understanding of things 
    written long ago because people back then had a different viewpoint. The passage in question is Luke 7:1-5 NKJV.
    "Judge not, that you not be judged. For with what judgement you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure
    you use, it will be measured back to you. And why do you look at the speck in your brothers eye, but do
    not consider the plank in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'let me remove the speck from your eye';
    and look, a plank is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see
    clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye." This is from the "Sermon on the Mount", Jesus is 
    talking to the Jewish people following Him. When you look at the whole passage you can see that the meaning is to not
    judge other people for things you yourself are doing, for you will be held to the same standard. By the way, the letters 
    after the passage label, NKJV, stand for New King James Version, which is an updated version written in modern English.
    I find it easier to read. If you are wondering which version of the Bible is the best, I have been told that it is 
    the one you will read.

<h3 id="Q3"> The Flood</h3>

<p>This has been a controversial topic for many years, one I feel can be better answered at <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/">Answers in Genesis</a>. When you get there scroll down to “Noah’s Flood: a Historical, Global Catastrophe”. 
    When you are done with that look around the site, there is so much information on it, written by many different people who have devoted their life to search for the truth.</p>
</article>
<article>
    <h3 id="Q4">Thou Shall Not Kill</h3>
    <p>The Hebrew word used in the Biblical text is not kill, it is murder. The difference is intent. 
    You kill someone accidently or to defend yourself, you murder on purpose. And by the way, the death penalty in 
    Biblical terms is not for punishment or retribution, it is "To remove the evil from your midst."
    Dead criminals do not commit crimes.</p>

<article>
  <h3 id="Q5">God, Why Didn’t You Answer My Prayer?</h3>
  <p>God answers all prayers, just not always in the way you expect or want, or on your timetable. He can see the big picture far into your
     future and knows what will be best for you. Sometimes the answer is no because that will be bad for you. Sometimes the prayer is answered 
     only when God knows you are ready.</p>

<article>
  <h3 id="Q6">Perilous Times and Perilous Men</h3>
  <p>But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men will be lovers of themselves, 
    lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  unloving,
     unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, 
     lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!
     For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins,
     led away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses,
     so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith;  but they will progress no further,
     for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was. NKJV 2 Ti 3:1–9</p>
  <p>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
     that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. NKJV 2 Ti 3:16–17

  <h3 id="Q7">Quarreling About Words</h3>
  <p>Paul telling Timothy, a young preacher, what to say to new generations of pastors: “Warn them before God against quarreling about words;
     it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.”  Or again: “Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.”
     Answer when you must; never fixate on the peripheral; do not lose the focus on what is primary; do not be enticed into stupid arguments. The real issues are simply too important.

  <h3 id="Q8">The Fool in Proverbs</h3>
  <p>
    Proverbs uses three different Hebrew words for fool: khesil, ewil, and nabal. The most common of these—khesil and ewil (nabal only occurs three times in Proverbs)—are essentially synonymous. Both describe someone who hates wisdom and knowledge (Prov 1:7; 1:22). In Proverbs 12:23 and Proverbs 13:16, fools (khesil) produce folly (iwweleth, from the Hebrew word ewil), linking the two terms.
    The fool in Proverbs is assured an ultimately destructive fate (Prov 10:14, 21). This destruction comes in part because of his rebellious attitude (Prov 10:8). Fools refuse instruction or discipline (Prov 15:5; 16:22; 17:10). Instead, they recklessly get themselves into trouble (Prov 14:16; 18:6). They are also arrogant (Prov 12:15) and untrustworthy (Prov 26:6). In contrast to the restrained speech of the wise (Prov 17:27), fools speak impulsively and argumentatively (Prov 20:3; 29:9, 11).
    There is a moral aspect to the fool. Job called his wife foolish when she advised him to “curse God and die” (Job 2:10). The fool prefers evil (Prov 10:23; 13:19) and rejects God (Ps 14:1). He rejects repentance (Prov 14:12), choosing instead to repeat his folly (Prov 26:11; 27:22). Fools tend to bring others down to their level (Prov 26:4) and should be avoided (Prov 13:20; 14:7).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Other Terms for the Fool</b>
    There are several other Hebrew terms that describe people related to the fool in Proverbs. The most common are lets (“scoffer”), ‘atsel (“sluggard”), chasar-lev (“lacks sense”), and pethi (“simple”). Other less common terms include remiyyah (“slothful”), na’ar (“child”), and ba’ar (“stupid”).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Scoffer</b>
    Scoffers (lets) are characterized by their attitude. Like the fool, the scoffer hates discipline (Prov 9:7–8; 13:1; 15:12). The arrogance of scoffers (Prov 21:24) prevents them from finding wisdom (Prov 14:6). They cause strife and conflict (Prov 22:10; 29:8) and are scorned by Yahweh and then condemned (Prov 3:33–34; 19:29).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Sluggard/Slothful</b>
    The Hebrew term atsel (“sluggard”) appears only in Proverbs, and is similar to remiyyah (“slothful”). Both terms describe a lazy or idle person. They appear in parallel (Prov 19:15) and are both contrasted with the diligent or hardworking person (Prov 10:4; 13:4). The sluggard is too lazy to work (Prov 21:25). Because of his laziness, the sluggard is described as ultimately ending up with nothing (Prov 13:4; 20:4). His land is overgrown (Prov 24:30), and he ends up in poverty (Prov 6:9–11; 10:4). He finds any excuses to stay in bed (Prov 26:13–14). Like the fool and scoffer, the sluggard believes himself to be wise (Prov 26:16).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Lacks Sense</b>
    The Hebrew phrase chasar-lev literally means “lacking heart” and implies a lack of intellect. Like the sluggard, the one who lacks sense is lazy and chases worthless pursuits instead of working (Prov 12:11; 24:30). He makes unwise decisions (Prov 17:18) and enjoys folly (Prov 15:21; iwweleth in Hebrew). His lack of discernment gets him into trouble (Prov 10:13). While he commits sins like adultery (Prov 6:32), his motivations are not the same as the fool or scoffer (Prov 3:33–34; 10:23; 13:19); rather, he falls victim to the adulteress’ temptation because of gullibility and weakness (Prov 7:7; 9:4; 9:16).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Simple</b>
    The one described by Proverbs as a simple person (pethi) is closely related to the person who lacks sense. He is gullible (Prov 14:15) and falls victim to temptation (Prov 7:7; 9:16). Proverbs generally characterizes the simple by folly (Prov 14:18; iwweleth in Hebrew). They get into trouble, not because of recklessness or arrogance like the fool (Prov 14:16; 18:6), but because they are oblivious or ignorant (Prov 22:3; 27:12). Unlike fools, scoffers, and sluggards, the simple can learn (Prov 1:4; 9:6) and respond to discipline (Prov 19:25; 21:11).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Child</b>
    The Hebrew term na’ar describes a “child” or “young man.” The child in Proverbs is not necessarily a fool, but is described as sometimes acting foolishly (Prov 22:15; iwweleth in Hebrew) or lacking sense (Prov 7:7; chasar-lev in Hebrew). The child is someone who needs instruction or discipline to prevent him from joining the ranks of the fool (Prov 22:6; 22:15; 23:13–14).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Stupid</b>
    The Hebrew term ba’ar (“stupid” or “brutish”) only occurs twice in Proverbs. Like the fool and scoffer, the stupid person hates discipline (Prov 12:1). He lacks wisdom, especially knowledge about God (Prov 30:2–3). In the Psalms the stupid person is paralleled with the fool (khesil); he is shown to lack understanding about the works of Yahweh, including the fate of the wicked (Ps 92:5–7).
