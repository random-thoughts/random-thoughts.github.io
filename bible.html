<h3>Things Often Misquoted and General Musings About the Bible</h3>

<p>The burden against the beasts of the South.
Through a land of trouble and anguish,
From which came the lioness and lion,
The viper and fiery flying serpent.<br>
Isaiah 30:6</p>

<hr>

<p>First I will give you a little of my background. I have been a life long Christian, being raised Catholic back when the Mass was done in Latin. 
    After High School and joining the US Army I drifted away, always believing in God but becoming disenchanted with the hypocrisy I saw in organized religion in general.
     Later I was introduced to a Non-Denominational group of Christians. I started to study the Bible on my own, learning about the how and why of it all. One day I was 
     browsing in a bookshop and I came across a CD that had Bible reading software on it. It contained 7 different versions of the Bible along with a library of Commentaries
      other related books. After using it my eyes were really opened. I now start every day reading and learning, looking up things I don’t fully understand. Here is a link to 
      the current version, <a href=" https://www.logos.com/ ">Logos 8</a>, along with a link to the Parent Company, <a href="https://faithlife.com/ ">faithlife.com</a> .
       While it may seem intimidating at first, the software is aimed at Pastors and Seminary students, there is a free basic version available along with excellent Help support if you need it.</p>
<p>On this page I will try to help clear up some of the misconceptions and misquotes about the Bible. I don't claim to know everything, and I don't want to challange anybody's faith, just shed a little light into the darkness.
     It is human nature to fear what we don’t understand, and we grow through learning, so let us grow together.</p>

<h3> Fear the Lord</h3>
<p>The first thing I want to say is that I think when the early translators used the phrase “Fear the Lord”, the word “fear” was a bad choice. Translating from one language to another is not an easy thing to do. 
     Sometimes they had to guess what word was the closest to the intended meaning. Logos has tool called the “Interlinear Explorer” that shows passages in different languages along with their meaning. 
     The Hebrew word used for fear means "to have a reverent attitude toward Yahweh that necessitates trust and obedience", so I guess they did the best they could. But the God I know is all about love, not fear.

<h3>Don't you Judge me</h3>

<p>I have been blessed by having good teachers in the faith. One of the first things I was taught was how to look at a passage. You need to know who is speaking, to whom they are speaking, and what is the situation.
     The Passage in question here is Luke 7:1-5 NKJV, “Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. 
     And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and look, a plank is in your own eye?
      Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.” This is from the “Sermon on the Mount”, Jesus is talking to the Jewish people following Him.
       When you look at the whole passage you can see that the meaning is don’t judge other people for something you yourself are doing, for you will be held to the same standard. 
       By the way, the letters after the passage label, NKJV, stand for New King James Version. This is an updated version of the King James Bible written in modern English, which I find much easier to read. 
       If you are wondering which Bible is the best, I have been told it is the one you will read.</p>

<h3> The Flood</h3>

<p>This has been a controversial topic for many years, one I feel can be better answered at <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/">Answers in Genesis</a>. When you get there scroll down to “Noah’s Flood: a Historical, Global Catastrophe”. 
    When you are done with that look around the site, there is so much information on it, written by many different people who have devoted their life to search for the truth.</p>
