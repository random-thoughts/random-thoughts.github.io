<p>The other day I was watching a Star Wars movie and it came to me that the “Woke Generation” probably see themselves as the Rebel Alliance. But in reality, which is itself a concept that seems to elude them, they are more closely aligned with the Dark Side. They want everyone to conform to their way of thinking, just like the Empire and all dictators throughout history. They are against freedom of thought, speech, action, and self reliance, all the things in the U.S. Constitution.  </p>

<p>Just because a great scientist held a hypothesis is no reason to believe it. As Nobel laureate biologist Peter Medawar remarked,
I cannot give any scientist of any age better advice than this: the intensity of a conviction that a hypothesis is true has no bearing on whether it is true or not. The importance of the strength of our conviction is only to provide a proportionately strong incentive to find out if the hypothesis will stand up to critical evaluation.</p>
