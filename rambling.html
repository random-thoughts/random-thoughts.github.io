<p>“The Japanese say you have three faces. The first face, you show to the world. The second face, you show to your close friends and your family.
   The third face, you never show anyone. It is the truest reflection of who you are.”

<p>The other day I was watching a Star Wars movie and it came to me that the “Woke Generation” probably see themselves as the Rebel Alliance.
   But in reality, which is itself a concept that seems to elude them, they are more closely aligned with the Dark Side. They want everyone to 
   conform to their way of thinking, just like the Empire and all dictators throughout history. They are against freedom of thought, speech, action,
    and self reliance, all the things in the U.S. Constitution.  </p>

<p>From a purely biological perspective, it would not take a rocket scientist to hypothesize that women are biased toward commitment from a man who will protect them and their children, rather than moving on and spawning more children with other women.
Ultimately, while we do not choose our sexual attractions, we do choose our sexual actions. </p>

<p>Just because a great scientist held a hypothesis is no reason to believe it. As Nobel laureate biologist Peter Medawar remarked,
I cannot give any scientist of any age better advice than this: the intensity of a conviction that a hypothesis is true has no bearing on whether it is true or not. The importance of the strength of our conviction is only to provide a proportionately strong incentive to find out if the hypothesis will stand up to critical evaluation.</p>

<p>You may have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy's Law</a>, which is "If something can go wrong it will, at the worst possible time." 
   There is also a variant for service people fixing things on-site, "No matter how many tools you take in with you what you need is back on the truck."</p>

<p>Learning is a life-long process. Everyone you meet, everything you experience, teaches you something. Sometimes the lesson is as simple as “Don’t Do That!”</p>
